A Blog
======

Ok.  I'm starting a blog so I can start documenting my findings and trials with getting into web development via Ruby Rails.  This is my first foray into web development and my first ever blog!

I'm using Octopress as my bloggin platform.  Fittingly it's built from Rails around Jekyll.
